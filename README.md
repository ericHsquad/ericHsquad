## Hi there 👋

My name is Eric, and I'm a certified AWS Solutions Architect, Databricks GenAI Fundamentalist, and Python Practitioner interested in all things Data and AI.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on enhacing a remote patient monitoring platform using AI and Quantum computing.
- 🌱 I've recently built a remote patient monitoring platform ingesting patient data from wearables and visualizing trends on a physician dashboard.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on emerging technologies.
  - Send me ideas to ehobbs@phoenixAI.health
