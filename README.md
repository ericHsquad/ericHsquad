## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eric, and I'm a certified cloud and python practitioner interested in all things Data Engineering and AI.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on enhacing a remote patient monitoring platform using AI and Quantum computing.
- ðŸŒ± I've recently built a remote patient monitoring platform ingesting patient data from wearables and visualizing trends on a physician dashboard.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on emerging technologies.
  - Send me ideas to ehobbs@phoenixinnovation.net
